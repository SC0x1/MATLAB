##Description
This is a prototype of smoothing steering on keyboard. Which is based on a Pulse-width modulation (PWM).

The result of steering will be fully depend on how faster you press the buttons.

And, you can achieve a nice control on keyboard as if you were using Joystick.

**-1** (means full left)

**0** (centering wheels)

**1** (full right)

### Usage
To simulate steering input just press 'A'/'D' keys
